The major difference between absolute and relative position values has to do with what the article refers to as the *normal flow* of the document. While it is true that both values allow you to adjust an element with offset properties: top,right, bottom, and left, only the absolute value allows you to disrupt the *normal flow of the document*. This means that elements with an absolute position can be placed just about anywhere on page; they do not need to be stacked up on top of each other. It seems like the absolute value allows for more flexibility in regards to where boxes are positioned.

The border-box value allows you to increase padding or borders without increasing the over height and width of the box. This is very useful when we have boxes within boxes. The border-box value prevents any inner-box from bleeding into the edges of the outer box's padding or from bleeding outside the bounds of the outer box entirely.
